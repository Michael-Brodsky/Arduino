This directory contains project files for a Programmable Rotary Actuator device
implemented on an Arduino Uno with an attached LCD/Keypad Shield. The device 
controls a servo motor that can be used to position rotary valves or similar 
mechanisms automatically according to a user-defined sequence and timing 
intervals. The device is controllable, programmable and configurable directly, 
via the LCD/Keypad Shield, or remotely via a serial communications protocol. 
A video demonstration can be viewed here:

FILES:
ProgrammableRotaryActuator.ino - top-level project file.
config.h - project configuration file.
Win32Setup.zip - Windows installer/setup for serial remote control app (optional).

NOTES:
This project has several library dependencies and users should download and 
install all of the files in `/libraries' to a suitable location for Arduino 
libraries on their local machine.

A brief description and usage is included as inline comments in the top-level 
project file.
