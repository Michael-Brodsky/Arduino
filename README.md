Arduino Libraries, Projects & Examples

This repo is a collection of Arduino C++ libraries, complete projects and examples.
It consists of a collection of generic, reusable C++ libraries written using 
modern object-oriented methodologies, design patterns and idioms, that are useful 
in microcontroller applications.

The motivation for this project was essentially necessity - I often found myself 
rewriting the same code for common tasks such as polling keypads, driving displays, 
executing functions based on timing intervals, and managing several of these tasks 
concurrently. So I started compiling a library of generic, reusable objects, written 
using modern C++11 object-oriented solutions. The result is this repo. This is a 
work in progress and by no means complete.

This repo is meant for advanced C++ developers. If you understand terms like 
range-based for loops, container/iterator idiom, template meta-programming and the 
like, please dive right in.
