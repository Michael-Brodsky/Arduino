STL 

Implements basic features of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).

This is a work in progress. Currently there is only one STL container 
type: std::array and an ArrayWrapper type for encapsulating C-style 
arrays of indeterminate size to give them the same behaviors as 
std::array. The type is fully supported with member functions, non-
member functions, iterators and algorithms according to the std::array 
specification.

The shortcomings of the Arduino platform place limitations on what and 
how features are supported. The lack of full namespace support requires 
types names be unique in the global namespace to prevent conflicts. 
Therefore all STL object names are preceded by "std_". For example 
std::array is std_array, std::iterator is std_iterator, std::begin is 
std_begin, and so on. Features that are supported and implemented in this 
library behave according to the STL specification and should be familiar
to the developer.
