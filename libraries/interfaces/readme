This library consists of several files that declare abstract interface types used by  
modern C++ design patterns.

FILES:
<ICommand.h> - interface types for implementing the "Command" pattern.
<IComponent.h>, <IMediator.h> - interface types for implementing the "Mediator" pattern.
<ICloneable.h> - interface type for implementing the "Virtual Constructor" idiom.
<IClockable.h> - custom interface type for creating asynchronous, event-driven objects.
<Callback.h> - templeted typdefs for easily defining callback types.

NOTES:
There are a few other interface classes defined in files located elsewhere, ususally 
because they have a specific purpose for in a particular library.
