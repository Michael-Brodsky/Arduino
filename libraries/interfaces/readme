This library consists of several files that declare abstract interface types used by  
modern C++ design patterns.

FILES:
<ICommand.h> - interface types for implementing the "Command" pattern.
<IComponent.h>, <IMediator.h> - interface types for implementing the "Mediator" pattern.
<ICloneable.h> - interface type for implementing the "Virtual Constructor" idiom.
