This library defines several types and functions for serializing/deserializing 
objects to and from the Arduino's EEPROM memory. 

FILES: 
<EEPROMStream.h>, <EEPROMStream.cpp> - defines a streaming class and support 
                                       functions for streaming data into and 
                                       out of the Arduino EEPROM memory.
<ISerializable.h> - abstract interface type for serializable objects.
